A C-based tool for analyzing NOAA's North American Mesoscale Forecast System data. It efficiently processes multiple data files, extracting information on humidity, temperature, snow cover, lightning strikes, and cloud cover. The tool computes key climate statistics, including average humidity, temperature, extreme temperature events, and lightning strike frequency. Performs calculations for average, maximum, and minimum values of humidity and temperature, as well as the frequency of extreme temperature events. The output presents structured insights into state climates, aiding research and analysis of regional weather patterns
